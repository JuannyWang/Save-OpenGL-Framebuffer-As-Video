Save-OpenGL-Framebuffer-As-Video
================================

This sample code shows how to save OpenGL framebuffer to a video using OpenCV. The opengl code is borrowed from [HeHe Lesson 05](http://nehe.gamedev.net/tutorial/3d_shapes/10035/).

The necessary libs and dlls are included in the project; therefore, you don't need to install OpenCV on your machine if you don't want to.
